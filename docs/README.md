OctoAcme Project Management Process Summary
Project Lifecycle & Core Workflows
OctoAcme follows a structured five-phase project lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Close & Retrospective. The process begins with a lightweight Project One-pager that validates business need, aligns stakeholders, and establishes success metrics before moving forward. Once approved, the planning phase breaks work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria, prioritized backlogs, and identified dependencies. Execution leverages a project board (GitHub Projects) with defined columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) and emphasizes small pull requests (≤400 lines), automated CI testing, and code review approvals before merging. This iterative, evidence-based approach ensures that teams deliver customer value incrementally while maintaining visibility and control over scope and timeline.

Roles, Responsibilities & Communication Cadence
OctoAcme defines clear ownership through four primary personas: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; Product Managers own the vision, prioritize the backlog, and measure outcomes; Developers implement features with quality and testability in mind; and QA/Testing validates acceptance criteria. Communication is structured through a regular cadence: daily standups (15 minutes) focus on progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs show progress and flagged risks, weekly PM-PdM alignment occurs on strategy and priorities, and monthly stakeholder updates keep executives informed. This multi-layered communication ensures that blockers are escalated systematically (team-level → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) and that all parties maintain shared understanding of status and trade-offs.

Quality Assurance & Risk Management
Quality is embedded throughout the execution cycle with unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and security scanning in CI. Manual QA validates feature acceptance when needed, and a Definition of Done ensures consistent quality standards before items move to completion. Risk management is continuous: teams maintain a Risk Register (tracking ID, Description, Impact, Likelihood, Owner, and Mitigation), identify risks during planning and ongoing execution, and review status weekly during syncs. Dependencies and high-impact risks are escalated early to prevent surprises, and teams prepare pre-release checklists and rollback plans to reduce deployment risk.

Continuous Improvement & Learning Culture
OctoAcme emphasizes psychological safety and iterative improvement through structured retrospectives held after each sprint, release, or milestone. Retrospectives capture what went well, what could improve, and actionable items with clear owners and due dates. Teams track and measure the impact of improvements, celebrating progress and making incremental adjustments to processes. This feedback loop, combined with data-informed decision-making and transparency in project artifacts (charters, risk registers, status reports), creates a culture where teams learn from each delivery cycle and continuously refine how they work together.


What's Included in the Summary:
Project Lifecycle & Core Workflows — The five-phase approach (Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, Close & Retrospective), the lightweight One-pager as a decision gate, iterative delivery with small PRs, and GitHub Projects board management.

Roles, Responsibilities & Communication Cadence — The four core personas (Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA/Testing), clear ownership structure, and the structured communication rhythm (daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, PM-PdM alignment, monthly stakeholder updates).

Quality Assurance & Risk Management — Embedded quality practices (unit tests, integration tests, E2E smoke tests, security scanning), Definition of Done, and the Risk Register approach with continuous monitoring and escalation paths.

Continuous Improvement & Learning Culture — Structured retrospectives, psychological safety, data-informed decision-making, and feedback loops that drive incremental process refinement.
